Hi {{name}},

Unfortunately you are using our Legacy views which we do not provide support anymore due to bugs like these that are complicated for us to track down and fix.

Please take a look at the article above about why we are no longer supporting that version of our codebase.

If you switch to the Updated Views and the problem continues, I would love to to try to help you get to the bottom of the problem

Best Regards,
